Hi,

I Came across a very useful site Seedr.cc which is very helpful in downloading torrent files.

It is free and will always remain the same.you just have to visit the site and just create an account.It can be done with your Google account also.

You will get 2GB of storage for free account and it can be increased by some simple tasks given on the website. You can also buy premium membership which come in many varieties.

You can either copy the torrent link or you can upload the torrent file on your account. Then it will provide you a direct link for downloading the file.

It is a gift for those students who cannot download a bittorrent client due to admin rights but want to download a torrent.

Once added, either you can download the video or you can stream it online also.

Just try it once,i know you will get addicted.!!

Thank You.
